This is a simple tool to bootstrap ec2 instances.

It generates a user data script that can be passed
to an instance on initialization.
Upon execution, the script install git and clones
a remote git repo and executes the file "run" inside it.

Other than that, it's responsibility of the external
git repo to provide the run script to bootstrap
the system (say install puppet or chef for example).

To use it just run:
 $> ./gen-ec2-userdata.sh <git repo url> <path to ssh private key>

I will generate a file called ec2-userdata.sh which you must use
as user data parameter to the ec2 instance.
